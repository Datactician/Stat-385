<p>In Stat 385 one of the main things weâ€™ve been working on is writing various and more complicated functions.</p>
<p>For example we wrote the following vectorized roulette function to simulate the rewards for a French Roulette.</p>
<p>A French roulette has:
37 colored and numbered pockets on the wheel.
0 is green.
In number ranges from 1 to 10 and 19 to 28:
Odd numbers are red.
Even numbers are black.
In ranges from 11 to 18 and 29 to 36:
Odd numbers are black.
Even numbers are red.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>roulette_vec = function(many_bets)
{
  win_lose_random &lt;- sample(x = c(TRUE, FALSE), size = length(many_bets),
                            replace = TRUE)
  many_bets[many_bets == &quot;high&quot;|| many_bets == &quot;low&quot;] = 10
  many_bets[many_bets == &quot;red&quot;|| many_bets == &quot;black&quot;] = 20
  many_bets[many_bets == &quot;odd&quot;|| many_bets == &quot;even&quot;] = 15
  many_bets[many_bets == &quot;first&quot;|| many_bets == &quot;second&quot; || many_bets == &quot;third&quot;] = 50
  ifelse(many_bets[win_lose_random], many_bets, 0)
}</code></pre>
<p>We have also been working on data visualizations:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(faithful$eruptions, breaks = 18, border = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, probability = TRUE, xlim = c(1,6), 
     ylim = c(0, 0.85), xlab = &quot;Eruption Time (mins)&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram of Old Faithful Geyser Eruption Time&quot;)
box()
grid()
lines(density(faithful$eruptions), lwd = 2, col = &quot;Orange&quot;)</code></pre>

My name is John Compton. I am a senior studying economics and statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I have a passion for using statistical analysis and machine learning models to be able to accurately predict and reveal information about a given dataset. This website will keep track of some of the projects and data analyses I am working on.
